# Issues we fixed in Iteration 1
======
We fixed the issue in iteration 1. We add test cases and make sure our program can pass all the unit test. We add comments and focus on clean code so that people can understand our code. We assign work to group members so every one can make efforts on it. 

Jacqueline: I fixed the issues in my Library class and finished the unit test. 

Gary: I helped Jacqueline with her code and complete the unit test. I also fix the issue in Jacqueline's code. 

Yubo: I checked everyone's pull request and do the code review. I write the script and finish the source code so that our program can run with it. 

Sherry: I add comments and pay attention to code cleanness. I also review the Books and Borrowers classes and unit test to make sure they can work properly. 

Besides individual work, all of us have meetings in person and Zoom frequently so that we can on the right way. We always discuss before do the actual coding. Therefore, although it looks like sometimes there is one person commit the code, we actually do the job together.

1. clone repo to your personal laptop locally.
