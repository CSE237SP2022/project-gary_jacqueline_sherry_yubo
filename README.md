Iteration1 - Summary

1. In this iteration, firstly we created three class, which are "Books", "Library" and "Borrow".
In Class "Books", we have declared member variables "id", "name", "borrowed" , "language" and "count".
We have finished the setter and getter methods of these variables as well.  


2. We intend to add more features and add unit test for the next iteration. 

3. We have not met any problems in coding so far, so there is NOTHING we implemented but doesn't work currently.
