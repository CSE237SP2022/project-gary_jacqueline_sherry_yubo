# Issues we fixed in Iteration 1 and Iteration 2

Iteration 1 :We fixed the issue in iteration 1. We added test cases and make sure our program can pass all the unit test. We add comments and focus on clean code so that people can understand our code. We assign work to group members so every one can make efforts on it. 

Iteration 2: We added more tests. There is a menu right now so the users can know how to use the system. We also removed some of the comments due to code cleanness.

Jacqueline: I fixed the issues in my Library class and add more tests. 

Gary: I helped Jacqueline with her code and complete the unit test. I also fix the issue in Jacqueline's code. 

Yubo: I checked everyone's pull request and do the code review. I did the menu so people can use the system properly. 

Sherry: I add comments and help Yubo to finish the menu. 

Besides individual work, all of us have meetings in person and Zoom frequently so that we can on the right way. We always discuss before do the actual coding. Therefore, although it looks like sometimes there is one person commit the code, we actually do the job together.
